## Description

In this project, I have built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer and MySQL. I have designed a database schema containing three tables#; employee, role and department for the company so the user can organize and plan their business.

## What did we do?

Built a command-line application that allows the user to:

- [x] Add departments, roles, employees
- [x] View departments, roles, employees
- [x] Update employee roles
- [x] View the utilized budget of a department - ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
- [x] Delete department

## Getting started

- Clone github project onto your local machine
- Navigate into the project
- Open the project into VS code

```

- Repo to include a `package.json` file by running `npm init -y` when you first set up the project.
- Add `start` script to `package.json`
- Create a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate our database
